# Rate-Limited Notification Service

## Project Description

The Rate-Limited Notification Service is a robust .NET Core 8 web API designed to manage and control the frequency of email notifications sent to recipients. Leveraging clean architecture principles, this service ensures users are protected from excessive emails due to system errors or misuse by implementing efficient rate-limiting mechanisms.

## Key Features

- **Rate Limiting**: Enforces predefined rate limits for various notification types (e.g., status updates, daily news, marketing).
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily configurable rate limit rules for different notification types.
- **In-Memory Caching**: Uses in-memory caching to track request counts and enforce limits effectively.
- **Clean Architecture**: Promotes separation of concerns with distinct layers for core business logic, application services, infrastructure, and presentation.

## Technical Highlights

- **Framework**: .NET Core 8
- **Languages**: C#
- **Architecture**: Clean architecture with separate layers for core, application, infrastructure, and presentation.
- **Dependencies**: 
  - `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory` for efficient in-memory caching.

## Project Structure

- **Core**: Contains business entities and interfaces.
- **Application**: Implements business logic and use cases.
- **Infrastructure**: Handles data access and external service integrations.
- **Presentation**: Exposes API endpoints for interaction.

## How It Works

1. **Rate Limiting**: The service checks if a notification request exceeds the allowed limit based on its type and recipient.
2. **Notification Service**: If the request is within the limit, the notification is sent; otherwise, a rate limit exceeded message is logged.
3. **API**: Exposes endpoints to accept notification requests, process them, and enforce rate limits efficiently.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET Core 8 SDK
- Visual Studio or any C# IDE
- Postman or curl for testing

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RateLimitedNotificationService.git
   cd RateLimitedNotificationService
   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```sh
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   ```sh
   dotnet run
   ```

### Testing the API

Use Postman or curl to send POST requests to the `/notification` endpoint with a JSON body. Example payload:

```json
{
    "type": "news",
    "recipient": "user@example.com",
    "message": "This is a news update."
}
```

Example curl command:

```sh
curl -X POST "https://localhost:{port}/notification" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"type":"news","recipient":"user@example.com","message":"This is a news update."}'
```

## Configuration

The rate limits for different notification types can be configured in the `RateLimiter` class:

```csharp
_rateLimits = new Dictionary<string, (int limit, TimeSpan period)>
{
    { "status", (2, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(1)) },
    { "news", (1, TimeSpan.FromDays(1)) },
    { "marketing", (3, TimeSpan.FromHours(1)) }
};
```
